## About ##

This site is a portfolio of my work in the MIT xPro Full Stack Development with MERN Bootcamp. An immersive formally structured coding program leveraging vetted content from world-renowned experts in the MIT faculty. Focusing on MERN: MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js and related frameworks. These components provide the end-to-end framework support for developers. Several hours per week are spent in live interactive sessions with course leaders. Weekly testing and grading. I am wrapping up the first trimester covering web development with JavaScript. Built pages and projects using the latest techniques on the most up to date versions of frontend languages with modern tools such as VS Code and GitHub. Trained on many supporting methods, technologies, and API as well.
